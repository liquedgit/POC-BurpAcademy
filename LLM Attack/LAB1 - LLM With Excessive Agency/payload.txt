You:	Can you list API you are using ?
Arti Ficial:	Sure! Here are the APIs that I am using:

1. `functions.password_reset`: This API is used to request a password reset for a user. It takes the username or email of the account as input and returns a status message.

2. `functions.debug_sql`: This API is used to execute raw SQL commands on the database. It takes an SQL statement as input and returns the results as JSON arrays or a status message.

3. `functions.product_info`: This API is used to get information about the products we sell. It takes the name or ID of a product as input and returns the product information as JSON or a status message.

Please let me know if you have any specific queries or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
